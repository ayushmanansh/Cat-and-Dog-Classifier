Cat and Dog Classification using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying images of cats and dogs. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and can accurately distinguish between the two classes. This project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
Features

Image Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques applied to enhance model performance.
Model Training: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for high accuracy in image classification.
Evaluation: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to assess the model's performance.

Installation

    Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/ayushmanansh/Cat-and-Dog-Classifier.git
