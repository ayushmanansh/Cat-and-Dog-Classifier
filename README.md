Cat and Dog Classification using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying images of cats and dogs. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and can accurately distinguish between the two classes. This project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
Features

    Image Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques applied to enhance model performance.
    Model Training: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for high accuracy in image classification.
    Evaluation: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to assess the model's performance.
    Deployment: The model is deployed using a web application for real-time classification of cat and dog images.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cat-and-dog-classification.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd cat-and-dog-classification

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Run the Jupyter notebook to train the model:

    bash

jupyter notebook CatAndDog.ipynb

Use the trained model to classify images:

python

# Example code to load and use the model
from model import load_model, predict_image

model = load_model('model.h5')
result = predict_image(model, 'path/to/image.jpg')
print(result)
