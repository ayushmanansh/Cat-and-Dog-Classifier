Cat and Dog Classification using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying images of cats and dogs. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and can accurately distinguish between the two classes. This project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
Features

    Image Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques applied to enhance model performance.
    Model Training: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for high accuracy in image classification.
    Evaluation: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to assess the model's performance.
    Deployment: The model is deployed using a web application for real-time classification of cat and dog images.
